# fbutils
R functions to manipulate data from the Android Field Book app

## Introduction
This package contains functions to handle the output from the Android FieldBook app. Information on the app can be founder [here](http://www.wheatgenetics.org/research/software/22-android-field-book) and the GitHub repository for Field Book can be found [here](https://github.com/trife/Field-Book). These functions are fairly basic and are meant for quick visualization of data throughout a field.

## Installation
The package can be installed via the `devtools` package:
```
devtools::install_github("neyhartj/fbutils")
```

## Shiny
This package is meant to be basic and quick to use. Therefore an accompanying [Shiny App](https://neyhartj.shinyapps.io/fbutils_shiny/) was created for use online. The web app
works on an Android tablet, too!
